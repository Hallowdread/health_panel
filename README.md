A Responsive Image Grid Layout Made With HTML &amp; CSS

This is a project i made from scratch by watching the tutorial: https://youtu.be/-qOe8lBAChE , i also added my own styles to the site too.

Your can clone the code and import on your code editor then run on your local web browser connected to wifi.

Enjoy!!
